Data Analysis on EPL Data. The data can be downloaded from https://www.football-data.co.uk/ . I have downloaded the data for 4 seasons from 2015-16 to 2018-19. The dataset is uploaded to this repo as well.

**HOW TO USE**:
  1. Download the notebook file (.ipynb) and upload it on your Anaconda/Visual Studio.
  2. Run/ Start the kernel.
  3. The code will ask for user input twice. You will have to provide team names:
      Input 1: Name of the team on which you want to perform the analysis on.
      Input 2: Name of the team which you want to compare the performance of Team 1 with.
  4. Enjoy the analysis.



**DESCRIPTION**:


The project gives user the ability to select the team they want to perform the analysis on. It always allows the user to select the opponent team and compare stats and HEAD-to-HEAD analysis for 2 teams.
I have made 2 hypothesis and tried to prove it using the analysis. Hypothesis:

HYPOTHESIS 1: A TEAM WINS MORE GAMES AT THEIR HOME GROUND.
   H0 (Null Hypothesis): There is HOME GAME advantage.
   H1 (Alternate Hypothesis): There is no HOME GAME advantage.
 
HYPOTHESIS 2:
  H0(Null Hypothesis): The team leading in first half WINS the match.
  H1(Alternate Hypothesis): The team leading in first half DOES NOT WIN the match.
